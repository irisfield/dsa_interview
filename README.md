# Daily DSA Practice Guide

##### 1. Focus on Core Algorithms and Data Structures

Practice the fundamental algorithms and data structures every day. Implement
them repeatedly from scratch until they become second nature.

##### 2. Emphasize Repetition

Repetition is key; it reinforces your understanding and skills. Solve one
problem for each algorithm every day. Feel free to revisit the previously solved problems
or tackle new ones.

##### 3. Understand the Concepts

Take time to grasp why each algorithm works:
- Use pen and paper to visualize the problem-solving process.
- Treat it like a real interview environment: verbalize your thought process as
  you work through the problem.
- Translate your thought proess into code.
- Work through example inputs to understand how the algorithm works.
- Test your code on LeetCode and see if it works.

##### 4. Learn the Patterns

Most interview coding problems can be solved by applying usually one of these
core algorithms. Learn to identify the patterns. It is usually an application of
the same algorithms, but the problem uses a different wording.

##### 5. LeetCode Practice

Solve two LeetCode problems every day to reinforce your knowledge and improve
your interviewing skills. But if a problem is too hard and you cannot solve
within 20 minutes (10 for understanding and 10 for writing), move on, and study
the solution instead.

# How To Start Learning a New Topic?

##### 1. Start With Basics

Start by learning what it is, how it is represented in code, and the various
operations you can perform on it, along with their time and space complexities.
For example, with binary search trees, grasp how they are represented and
familiarize yourself with common operations such as inserting a node, deleting
a node, and searching for a node.

##### 2. Real-World Applications

Understand where and how it is used in real-world scenarios. For example, graphs
are used in routing algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes in
a network, such as in GPS navigation systems. 

##### 3. Use Pen and Paper

Visualizing concepts on pen and paper enhances understanding and retention.
Create diagrams, flowcharts, and write pseudocode to illustrate how the data
structure or algorithm functions.

For instance, with linked lists, sketch the nodes and pointers to visualize how
they connect and to better understand operations like insertion and deletion.

##### 4. Implement It From Scratch

Write code to implement the data structure or algorithm from scratch. Doing this
yourself reinforces your understanding and helps you grasp the underlying
mechanics.

For example, implement a stack using either arrays or linked lists. Create
functions for the push, pop, and peek operations to fully understand how the
stack operates.

##### 5. Learn the Built-In Library Functions

Learn how to utilize the standard libraries in your programming language that
provide built-in data structures and algorithms.

For example, in Python, familiarize yourself with lists, sets, and dictionaries.
In Java, get to know ArrayList, HashMap, and TreeSet. Understanding these
libraries can significantly simplify your coding process and enhance your
efficiency.

##### 6. Solve Simple Problems
Just reading about a topic or watching tutorials is not enough. Practice solving
simple problems related to the topic to build confidence and reinforce your
learning. 

For instance, try solving 4-5 easy problems on LeetCode that pertain to the
topic you are currently studying. This hands-on practice will help solidify your
understanding.
